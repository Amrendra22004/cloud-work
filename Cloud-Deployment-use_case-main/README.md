# Cloud Computing Basics

## 1. Public Cloud

### Definition
A **Public Cloud** is a cloud computing model where resources such as servers, storage, and applications are provided by third-party service providers over the internet. These resources are shared among multiple users or organizations.

### Advantages
- Cost-effective due to shared infrastructure.
- No need for on-premises hardware or maintenance.
- Quick deployment and scalability.

### Disadvantages
- Limited control over data and infrastructure.
- Potential security and privacy concerns due to shared resources.

### Examples of Cloud Providers
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## 2. Private Cloud

### Definition
A **Private Cloud** is a cloud computing environment dedicated exclusively to a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider, but the resources are not shared with other users.

### Advantages
- Greater control over security, data, and compliance.
- Customizable to meet specific organizational needs.
- Enhanced privacy due to dedicated resources.

### Disadvantages
- Higher costs for setup, maintenance, and management.
- Requires in-house expertise or reliance on a provider.

### Examples of Cloud Providers
- VMware
- Red Hat OpenStack
- OpenStack

# Nested_cloud-use_case
This document outlines use cases for nested cloud architectures, specifying technologies and how virtual machines (VMs) or instances are deployed. It covers private-on-private, public-on-public, public-on-private, and private-on-public scenarios, with practical examples and named tools.

## 1. Private Cloud on Another Private Cloud

### Technology
- **Lower Layer**: OpenStack (IaaS private cloud)
- **Upper Layer**: Apache CloudStack (IaaS private cloud)

### Use Case
- **Scenario**: Secure data processing for a government agency with multi-level classification.
- **Details**:
  - OpenStack provisions VMs:
    - 1 VM for CloudStack management server (e.g., 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, Ubuntu 20.04).
    - 6 VMs for CloudStack compute nodes (e.g., 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM each, CentOS 8).
  - Apache CloudStack runs on these VMs, creating isolated tenant VMs for different security clearance levels (e.g., unclassified, confidential, secret) to process sensitive datasets.
- **Why**: A government agency uses OpenStack as its foundational private cloud and layers CloudStack on top to enforce strict isolation between data processing environments for compliance with security regulations.

### Example
- OpenStack VMs host an Apache CloudStack deployment that provisions tenant VMs for a defense agency, processing satellite imagery and intelligence reports in segregated environments within an on-premises, air-gapped data center.

## 2. Public Cloud on Another Public Cloud

### Technology
- **Lower Layer**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) - EC2 and S3
- **Upper Layer**: Microsoft Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network)

### Use Case
- **Scenario**: Global video streaming with optimized content delivery.
- **Details**:
  - AWS provisions:
    - 3 EC2 instances (e.g., m5.xlarge, 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM) for video transcoding.
    - S3 buckets store encoded video files.
  - Azure CDN integrates with AWS, pulling video files from S3 and caching them at edge locations (no VMs on Azure’s side for this layer).
- **Why**: A media company uses AWS EC2 instances for compute and storage, with Azure CDN for low-latency delivery to viewers worldwide.

### Example
- AWS EC2 instances transcode Netflix-like content, store it in S3, and Azure CDN distributes it to users, leveraging Azure’s edge network for cost-effective delivery.

## 3. Public Cloud on Any Private Cloud

### Technology
- **Lower Layer**: OpenStack (private cloud IaaS)
- **Upper Layer**: Custom Public Cloud Offering (resold IaaS service)

### Use Case
- **Scenario**: Monetizing excess private cloud capacity by offering it as a public cloud service.
- **Details**:
  - OpenStack provisions VMs in a private data center:
    - 10 VMs (e.g., 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM each, Ubuntu 22.04) initially allocated for internal workloads.
    - When internal demand drops, 5 of these VMs are left idle.
  - The organization reconfigures these spare VMs into a public-facing IaaS offering:
    - OpenStack’s Nova and Neutron expose the idle VMs to external customers via a public API.
    - Customers rent these VMs (e.g., as compute instances) for their own workloads, paying a fee.
- **Why**: A company with an OpenStack private cloud uses excess VM capacity to create a public cloud service, generating revenue from unused resources.

### Example
- A university runs OpenStack for internal research VMs. When projects wind down, it offers the spare VMs (e.g., 5 instances) to startups as a low-cost public cloud, charging per hour to fund its IT budget.

## 4. Private Cloud on Any Other Public Cloud

### Technology
- **Lower Layer**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Compute Engine
- **Upper Layer**: OpenStack (private IaaS cloud)

### Use Case
- **Scenario**: Running a private gaming server infrastructure on public cloud resources.
- **Details**:
  - GCP Compute Engine provisions:
    - 1 control node instance (e.g., n2-standard-4, 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM) for OpenStack services (Keystone, Nova).
    - 3 compute node instances (e.g., n2-standard-8, 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM each) for tenant VMs.
  - OpenStack runs on these GCP instances, creating its own VMs (e.g., 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM each) to host game servers for players.
- **Why**: A gaming company uses GCP instances to host an OpenStack private cloud, providing isolated server instances for multiplayer games with custom configurations.

### Example
- GCP instances run OpenStack, which provisions VMs for a company like Blizzard to host World of Warcraft private test servers, leveraging GCP’s scalability for peak player testing phases.

- Lockheed Martin uses a private cloud for classified defense projects on top of Microsoft Azure.
   - **Use Case**: Processes sensitive military data securely while tapping Azure for scalable simulation tools.
